myly attendance software provides a complete solution to schools to automate attendance taking, attendance reporting, leave application, leave approval and attendance analytics.

Integrated deeply with School Management Software , myly Attendance software allows schools to capture attendance in multiple ways - teacher taking attendance on app, taking attendance on web-panel or uploading attendance by excel file. Parents are notified on their app in case the child is marked absent or on-leave in the school. Parents can apply for leave from their app and even submit medical certificate from the app.
