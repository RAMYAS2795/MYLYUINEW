myly app has been a real boon for all the students, staff and community. It has allowed all of us to stay connected and engaged like a one big happy family. There are so many features in the app, yet it is so user friendly and easy to use. Alerts, reminders, photos, attendance, application, online fee submission, you name the feature, the app has it.

The regular use of the app has ensured that there is no confusion between the school and parent/teacher as every information reaches them on time and also keeps the parent updated about their childâ€™s progress regularly.
