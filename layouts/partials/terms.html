You agree not to use any false, inaccurate or misleading information when signing up for your EduCommerce Technologies account or <b class="my-blue">myly</b> account. In some cases, a third party, may have assigned an EduCommerce Technologies account to you. If you received your EduCommerce Technologies account from a third party, the third party may have additional rights over your account, like the ability to access or delete Your EduCommerce Technologies account.

                            <li><strong>2 Account use.</strong> You must use your EduCommerce Technologies account to keep it active. This means you must sign in at least once in a 6-month period to keep your EduCommerce Technologies account, and associated Services, active, unless provided otherwise in an offer for a paid portion of the Services. If you don’t sign in during this time, we will assume your EduCommerce Technologies account is inactive and will close it for you. Please see section 4(a)(iv)(2) for the consequences of a closed EduCommerce Technologies account. If we reasonably suspect that your EduCommerce Technologies account or <b class="my-blue">myly</b> account is being used by a third party fraudulently (for example, as a result of an account compromise), EduCommerce Technologies may suspend your account until you can reclaim ownership.</li>

Changes made to your billing account will not affect charges we submit to your billing account before we could reasonably act on your changes to your billing account.</li>
                                <li><strong>Billing.</strong> By providing EduCommerce Technologies with a payment method, you (i) represent that you are authorized to use the payment method that you provided and that any payment information you provide is true and accurate; (ii) authorize EduCommerce Technologies to charge you for the Services or available content using your payment method; and (iii) authorize EduCommerce Technologies to charge you for any paid feature of the Services that you choose to sign up for or use while these Terms are in force. We may bill you (a) in advance; (b) at the time of purchase; (c) shortly after purchase; or (d) on a recurring basis for subscription Services. Also, we may charge you up to the amount you have approved, and we will notify you in advance of any change in the amount to be charged for recurring subscription Services. We may bill you at the same time for more than one of your prior billing periods for amounts that haven't previously been processed.</li>
                                <li><strong>Automatic renewal.</strong> Provided that automatic renewals are allowed in your country and state, we will inform you by email before automatically renewing your Services, unless purchased on a subscription basis. Once we have informed you that the Services will be automatically renewed, we may automatically renew your Services and charge you the then current price for the renewal term. We will also remind you that we will bill your chosen payment method for the Services renewal, whether it was on file on the renewal date or provided later. We will also provide you with instructions on how you may cancel the Services. You must cancel the Services before the renewal date to avoid being billed for the renewal.</li>
                                <li><strong>Refund policy.</strong> Unless otherwise provided by law or by a particular Service offer, all purchases are final and non-refundable. If you believe that EduCommerce Technologies has charged you in error, you must contact us within 90 days of such charge. No refunds will be given for any charges more than 90 days old. We reserve the right to issue refunds or credits at our sole discretion. If we issue a refund or credit, we are under no obligation to issue the same or similar refund in the future. This refund policy does not affect any statutory rights that may apply.</li>
                                <li><strong>Canceling the services.</strong> You may cancel a Service at any time, with or without cause. Please send an email to <a href="mailto:support@mylyapp.com">support@mylyapp.com</a> for details on the cancellation process &amp; formalities prevailing at that time. You should refer back to the offer describing the Services as (i) you may not receive a refund at the time of cancellation; (ii) you may be obligated to pay cancellation charges; (iii) you may be obligated to pay all charges made to your billing account for the Services before the date of cancellation; or (iv) you may lose access to and use of your account when you cancel the Services. If you cancel, your access to the Services ends at the end of your current Service period or, if we bill your account on a periodic basis, at the end of the period in which you canceled.</li>
                                <li><strong>Trial-period offers.</strong> If you are taking part in any trial-period offer, you must cancel the trial Service(s) by the end of the trial period to avoid incurring new charges, unless we notify you otherwise. If you do not cancel the trial Service(s) by the end of the trial period, we may charge you for the Service(s).</li>
                                <li><strong>Promotional offers.</strong> From time to time, EduCommerce Technologies may offer Services for a trial period during which EduCommerce Technologies will not charge you for the Services. EduCommerce Technologies reserves the right to charge you for such Services (at the normal rate) in the event that EduCommerce Technologies determines (in its reasonable discretion) that you are breaching the terms and conditions of the offer.</li>
                                <li><strong>Price changes.</strong> We may change the price of the Services at any time and if you have a recurring purchase, we will notify you by email at least 15 days before the price change. If you do not agree to the price change, you must cancel and stop using the Services before the price change takes effect. If there is a fixed term and price for your Service offer, that price will remain in force for the fixed term.</li>
                                <li><strong>Payments to you.</strong> If we owe you a payment, then you agree to timely and accurately provide us with any information we need to get that payment to you. You are responsible for any taxes and charges you may incur as a result of this payment to you. You must also comply with any other conditions we place on your right to any payment. If you receive a payment in error, we may reverse or require return of the payment. You agree to cooperate with us in our efforts to do this. We may also reduce the payment to you without notice to adjust for any previous overpayment.</li>

                            <h5>Binding arbitration and class action waiver If You live In (or If a business your principal place of business is in) the United States. </h5>
                            <p>We hope we never have a dispute, but if we do, you and we agree to try for 60 days to resolve it informally. If we can’t, you and we agree to binding individual arbitration before the American Arbitration Council under the Indian Arbitration &amp; Conciliation Act 1996, and not to sue in court in front of a judge or jury. Instead, a neutral arbitrator will decide and the arbitrator’s decision will be final. Class action lawsuits, class-wide arbitrations, private attorney-general actions, and any other proceeding where someone acts in a representative capacity aren’t allowed. Nor is combining individual proceedings without the consent of all parties. "We," "our," and "us" includes EduCommerce Technologies, <b class="my-blue">myly</b> (see section 10) and EduCommerce Technologies’ affiliates. </p>

                                <li><strong>Disputes covered—everything except IP. </strong>The term "dispute" is as broad is it can be. It includes any claim or controversy between you and us concerning the Services, the software related to the Services, the Services’ or software’s price, your EduCommerce Technologies account, your <b class="my-blue">myly</b> account, or these Terms, under any legal theory including contract, warranty, tort, statute, or regulation, except disputes relating to the enforcement or validity of your, your licensors’, our, or our licensors’ intellectual property rights.</li>
                                <li><strong>Mail a notice of dispute first. </strong>f you have a dispute and our customer service representatives can’t resolve it, send a Notice of Dispute by registered post to EduCommerce Technologies Pvt. Ltd., ATTN: CEO, Suite #5EW, Neil Rao Towers, EPIP Phase – 1 Whitefield, Bengaluru – 560066 INDIA. Tell us your name, address, how to contact you, what the problem is, and what you want. We’ll do the same if we have a dispute with you. After 60 days, you or we may start an arbitration if the dispute is unresolved.</li>
                                <li><strong>Arbitration Procedure. </strong> The Indian Arbitration Council will conduct any arbitration under its Rules. The arbitrator may award the same damages to you individually as a court could. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only to you individually to satisfy your individual claim.</li>
                                <li>Must File Within One Year. You and we must file in small claims court or arbitration any claim or dispute (except intellectual property disputes—see section 15.a) within one year from when it first could be filed. Otherwise, it's permanently barred.</li>
                                <li><strong>Rejecting future arbitration changes. </strong> You may reject any change we make to section 15 (except address changes) by sending us notice within 30 days of the change by Registered to the address in section 15.b. If you do, the most recent version of section 15 before the change you rejected will apply.</li>
                                <li><strong>Severability. </strong> If the class action waiver is found to be illegal or unenforceable as to all or some parts of a dispute, then those parts won’t be arbitrated but will proceed in court, with the rest proceeding in arbitration. If any other provision of section 15 is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that provision will be severed but the rest of section 15 still applies.</li>

If a court or arbitrator holds that we can't enforce a part of these Terms as written, we may replace those terms with similar terms to the extent enforceable under the relevant law, but the rest of these Terms won't change. Section 15(f) says what happens if parts of section 15 (arbitration and class action waiver) are found to be illegal or unenforceable. Section 15(f) prevails over this section if inconsistent with it. Except for Section 15 (arbitration and class action waiver) these Terms are solely for your and our benefit; they aren’t for the benefit of any other person, except for EduCommerce Technologies’ successors and assigns. </p>
