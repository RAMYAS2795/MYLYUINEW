myly Transport Software provides a quick and secure way to track the location of all your school vehicles that ferry students to and from the school.

Each vehicle is fitted with a GPS tracking unit which allows school authorities to see the location of the vehicles from their web-panel access. School can create groups of students for each vehicle. Parents of these students can see the location of their child's vehicle in their myly app in real-time. We also provide RFID based attendance and video camera integration with the GPS device.
